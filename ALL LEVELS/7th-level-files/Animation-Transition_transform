Transition - It will make ur transition smoother or faster depending on your needs
transition-property- defines you want to use it on everyone(all) or none
transition-duration - for how much your transition will takes place
transition-timing-function: it defines the transition how it will perform in starting, ending while transition
transition-delay: after how much time the transition will start

Short Hand
transition: all, transition-duration, transition-timing-function(effect), transition-delay;

Tranform- It tranforms your element it rotates, scales up or down, its skews and it translates
Rotate - it rotates your element in your respective degree and we can also control in it respective direction, rotatex(),rotatey(),rotatez(),
scale - it works in times method if u put 2, it means it is 2x of the size u mentioned before
scalex(), scaley() are its types
Translate - It moves the element from it's position to the mentioned position default value is in x axis
we can make it go diagonally also using translate(50px, 50px)
we can use it as translatex() for x axis, translatey() for y axis
skew- it tilt the element in the respective direction in x axis or y axis with the entered degree skewx or skewy

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Animation: firstly we have to define what animation we want from where to where
@keyframes #NameOfAnimation{
from{top:10px;}
to{top:258px;}
}
then we have to use it in that element's styling where we want to use it
.box{
    Animation-Name:#NameofAnimation;-- which is defined earlier
    Animation-duration:2s; --for how much time it will go on
    animation-timing-function:ease, ease-in, ease-in-out, linear...others;
    animation-delay:1s; ---for how much time it will delay
    animation-iteration-count: for how much times it will go--infinite, 5 times, or whatever;
    animation-direction:reverse, alternate-reverse, alternate, normal(default);

    shortHand--
    animation:name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction;

    example
    animation:Chala 4s ease-in-out 0s infinite alternate;
