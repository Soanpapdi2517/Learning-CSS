Padding:- It is inside the border and defines how content for example "Click me" inside button will appear
runs clockwise TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT
-----------------------------------------------------
Border:- padding and border combines and gives exact amount of px of how much that particular element in box model is taking

syntax border: border pixels, (solid, dashed, dotted), color;
-----------------------------------------------------
border radius- used to make box round ended or circle by defining it radius to the square
syntax;- border-radius top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left.
-----------------------------------------------------
Margin:- It defines the spaces between two objects or two elements 
runs clockwise TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT

If we have two objects or elements with 
1. div element with margin 20px, 30px, 40px, 50px
2. div element with margin 40px, 30px, 40px, 50px
Margin between two div elements will be 40px it is not added like Top + bottom
and if one of them have bigger margin then the distance will be that margin between these two
-----------------------------------------------------
Box-sizing:- it is a method to make our element or it's box sizing limited to what we expect for example if i want my border as 50 x 50 pixel i will use border box method and it will shrink the content or padding to meet my needs

or if i want it to expand how much the elements wants then we can use content-box method which is default already
